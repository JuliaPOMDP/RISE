    "# Artificial Intelligence Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial introduces some basic consepts from Artificial Intelligence. The majority of this tutorial involves watching videos from the Udacity course on [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271), with some follow up questions to get you thinking about some of the concepts on a more applied level. You will need to create an account with Udacity before you can start the course. "
